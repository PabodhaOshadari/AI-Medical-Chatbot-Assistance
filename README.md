# AI Medical Chatbot Assistance

This project is an AI-powered medical chatbot that provides accurate, context-aware answers to user questions using content from **The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine ‚Äì Second Edition**. It combines **Flask** for the web interface, **LangChain** for retrieval-augmented generation, **Hugging Face sentence-transformer embeddings** for semantic understanding, and **Pinecone** as the vector database for storing and retrieving document chunks. **OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini** model generates concise answers based on the retrieved context. The chatbot is ideal for learning, research, and exploring trusted medical information.

## üöÄ How to Run

Follow these steps to get your AI Medical Chatbot up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/ai-medical-chatbot.git](https://github.com/yourusername/ai-medical-chatbot.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd ai-medical-chatbot
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Add your medical PDFs** to the `Data/` folder.
5.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory with your API keys:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
    ```
6.  **Generate the vector store:** This processes your PDFs, creates chunks, embeds them, and uploads them to Pinecone.
    ```bash
    python src/create_vector_store.py
    ```
7.  **Start the Flask app:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
